# MarsRover
Stuck on Mars with only your rover and 10 days of food, you must find a way to survive the barren wasteland that is Mars. A fun little side project based on "The Martian" by Andy Weir
Idealy a real time game that focuses on finding materials to fix your rover and survive Mars. May include graphics / visuals in future editions, but uses debug console.
